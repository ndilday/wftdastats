        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p>
            The <a href="http://wftda.com/files/wftda-rankings-calculator.pdf" target="_blank">WFTDA algorithm</a> for calculating team rankings is mathy.
            Not everybody loves mathy. While lots of people have written spreadsheets to help them determine certain pieces about their team's ranking,
            one of the things wftda's algorithm doesn't do a good job of (because it's not really its goal) is saying how likely a particular outcome is.
        </p>
        <p>
            That is a problem that <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/" target="_blank">FlatTrackStats</a> has taken on.
            They have <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/about/algorithm/detailed" target="_blank">detailed notes</a> on the math
            that goes into their predictor tool. While they have a high degree of accuracy when it comes to win/loss predictions,
            I do not believe detailed analysis of their win margin predictions has been done. Still, it provides <b>a</b> baseline
            against which different matchups can be compared.
        </p>
        <p>
            By combining the Rankings math of WFTDA with the prediction math of FTS, teams can make more informed decisions about matchups
            that make sense for them. The tools in this section are various visualizations of that data.

        <h5>Tool Descriptions</h5>
        <p>
            The <b>Rankings Table</b> is the most straightforward view, simply presenting the WFTDA and FTS data side by side.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>Matchup Wizard</b> is a tool for teams who want an overview of good matchups. 
            It looks at the share of points a team needs in a given matchup to increase their WFTDA Rankings Points,
            and compares that to the expected point shares expected by FTS.  It then shows matchups where both teams are expected to gain
            WFTDA Rankings Points (what I call "win-win" games), and matchups where the first team is expected to gain points,
            but the second team is not (what I call "one-sided" games).
