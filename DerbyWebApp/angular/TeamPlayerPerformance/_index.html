        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p>
            I recommend, before you read any farther, you give 
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/the-nutcrackers/statistics-and-roller-derby-the-best-deception/216269045054346/">this article</a>
            a read. It was written by a WFTDA Division 1 A-Manager that I have a lot of respect for, and I think many of the points are valid.
            However, while I think derby is harder to statistically analyze than basketball, I suspect it's approximately in the same range
            as hockey. Basketball has shown itself to be a far more statistically analyzable game than originally thought, with the work of David Berri
            (popularized via the book <i>Wages of Wins</i> and the <a href="http://wagesofwins.com/">blog of the same name</a>) being a prominent example.

            So, I decided to start taking a shot at quantifying performance in roller derby; specifically, WFTDA sanctioned matches which are logged
            in Rinxter starting in 2014. (I decided to start with 2014 in part because that was the year I became involved with roller derby, and in part
            because it was the first year WFTDA moved to all penalties being 30 second penalties, meaning that I didn't have to try to create a single
            performance measuring system that took both the old and the new penalty system into account.)

            <b>Methodology</b> describes how I go about calculating performance from the data available via Rinxter. I expect it to be a living document,
            so don't be surprised if the format changes over time.

            The <b>Team Performance Calculator</b> is a way to view one version of my player analysis. One problem with trying to compare players across
            all of WFTDA is that there is a very wide range of talent and training across different WFTDA teams, and since WFTDA teams choose their own
            bouts, strength of opposition disparities can lead to players having impressive looking seasonal stats due to facing off against predominantly
            weaker teams. (You can see similar problems in other sports when you compare college athletes to professional atheletes, 
            or minor league players to major league players. How many of the best lower-system players are better than the worst upper-system players?
            How can you evaluate that? Even in derby, the question of how well a home-team player will perform at the A-level may not be as 
            simple as saying the best home team player is the best A-level player.)
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid those sorts of issues, the Team Performance Calculator looks at a single team at a time, and attempts to compare player performance
            only within that team. This still leaves open the possibility that one player is consistently facing off against easier opposition than a
            teammate, either by virtue of a team strategy or luck of the rotation. While I'm not sure the effect should be large at the Division 1 and
            Division 2 levels of play, it is something that I will hopefully integrate into the system in future versions.
