        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
            I want to start by being clear on one thing: this is all <a href="">Ginger Kid</a>'s fault.
            When she and I met, she was a captain of the <a href="">Boston Derby Dames</a>, and playoff
            time was fast approaching. As a result, rostering questions were present in her mind. That,
            combined with my unhealthy interest in sports statistics (I'm the sort of sports nerd who
            doesn't just have books on statistics, but books on <b>the history of statistics in sports)
            and my day job writing software and the databases that back them made for a potent combination.

            It became pretty clear pretty quickly that commentators for roller derby were making the same
            player evaluation shortcuts that happened in other sports. The clearest analogy for me is
            basketball. In basketball, commentators love to talk about every statistic in per-game terms.
            This is especially glaring with points; an NBA player who scores over 25 points per game is
            a revered figure.

        <h2>How Basketball Change My Life</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in Southeast Virginia, and am a few years younger than one of the most recent NBA
            stars from that area: Allen Iverson. Iverson was a somewhat controversial player for a
            number of reasons, but there was one thing that just about everyone agreed on: Iverson
            was a great offensive player. He was regularly vying for the scoring title (i.e. having
            the most points per game in the league) for most of his career, despite being a point
            guard, a position usually considered to be more facilitating than direct.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was near the end of Iverson's best years that a sports economics professor started asking
            some pointed questions about basketball evaluation, two of which were central to how I started
            thinking about roller derby statistics.

        <h2>Question 1: Why Do We Measure Player Output By Game?</h2>
        <p>
            There are some games where players are expected to play an entire game; in baseball, for example,
            every position except for the pitcher will play most to all of a game, only being removed because
            of injury or a switch to more defensive players to protect a lead late in the game. But in
            basketball, hockey, and roller derby, it is exceedingly rare for a player to play the entire game.
            Just as importantly, not all players will play the same portion of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the world of derby, one example that stands out is the difference between blocker rotations and
            jammer rotations. On most teams, good blockers are put in every other jam, while most jammers are
            playing every third jam or so. As a result, if you simply compared the points a jammer scored in
            a game to the points a blocker gave up in a game, the top blockers will certainly appear to be 
            giving up more points per game than the jammers are scoring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thankfully, in roller derby, we have a better (although not perfect) alternative: the jam.
