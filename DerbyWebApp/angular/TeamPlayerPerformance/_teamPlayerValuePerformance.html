    <h5>Explanation of Columns</h5>
    <p> A few of the columns in the tables below aren't self-explanatory.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Jam: </b> Instead of just being a count of the jams a player was "in", this is an approximation of the portion of jams that player was on the track.
        For example, if a player served a full penalty in a 60-second jam, they contributed less than 0.5 of the full jam ("less than" because of time taken
        getting to the box and time returning to the track).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Normal Delta:</b> Over a large database of bouts, the average point delta teams achieve in jams with similar penalty situations.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Actual Delta:</b> The difference between this team's points and the opposing team's points in this jam.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Penalty Cost:</b> An approximation of how much the player's penalties commited in this jam cost the team.
        This will include the cost of all the box time served for those penalties, not just the cost of the box time within the same jam.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>VVM:</b> Value Versus Median. This is the result of a formula that looks at how much of the jam the player was in,
        and how well that jam went and estimates how that player performed relative to the average in that jam.
        This value <b>does not take penalties into account</b>!
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>AVVM:</b> Average Value Versus Median. This is just VVM divided by the jam value, and gives a sense of how well this player performed 
        <b>while on the track</b> (i.e. ignoring the cost of penalties).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>AJV:</b> Average Jam Value. VVM minus Penalty Cost, divided by the jam portions. This value gives a sense of the aggregate effect of
        all of a player's actions on the track.
    </p>

                The fewer jams a player is in, the less their results can be compared to another player. (That's why I've sorted the lists by number of jams.)
                Be especially skeptical of comparing players who did not play in the same games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pivots are tricky to represent. Right now, pivot blocker stats are being affected by the scoring that occurs 
                after they've been passed the star in a jam, which isn't quite right.
