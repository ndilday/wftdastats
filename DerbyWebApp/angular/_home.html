    <h2>Welcome to WFTDAStats.com</h2>
    <p>
        First things first: I have absolutely no affiliation with <a href="http://wftda.com">WFTDA</a>. I think they're a great organization.
        I love going to their bouts. I have many friends who play in WFTDA leagues. But I am not a member of any WFTDA league, I do not speak
        for any WFTDA league, I don't work for WFTDA, etc, etc. This project is a labor of love that I've worked on over many months based on
        the data made available via the <a href="http://rinxter.com/www/?p=266" target="_blank">Rinxter API</a>. I commend WFTDA for having
        the foresight to make their stat data publicly available in that form, and I hope that they find a way to import statbooks into Rinxter,
        and that their next generation of derby data tools will be just as open and useful to the public.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, there are two main "buckets" of data I'm making available. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The first is my attempt to integrate <a href="http://wftda.com/rankings" target="_blank">WFTDA Rankings</a> data with 
        <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/rankings" target="_blank">FTS Rankings</a> data (and the math backing each) 
        to give teams better tools for evaluating what matchups make sense for them. I am hoping to eventually extend this to give 
        ranking estimates as bout results come in.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second, and far more experimental, body of work I'm making available here is my first pass at comparing the impact different players
        have on the game.
